<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<h3>1.1 Purpose of the system</h3>
<p>
A pandemic simulation system for education called SimuCrisis was created with Unity.
Its goal is to assist users in investigating the ways in which pandemic management
choices such as lockdowns, vaccination plans, and modifications to healthcare capacity
affect the spread of viruses and the burden on healthcare systems. The system is aimed at
politicians, researchers, educators, and students.
</p>

<h3>1.2 Design goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>A visual representation of pandemic dynamics that is easy to understand.</li>
<li>Availability on common desktop hardware (VR was eliminated because of its low added value).</li>
<li>Instantaneous feedback for parameter adjustments and interventions.</li>
<li>Architecture that is flexible, maintainable, and modular.</li>
<li>Reproducibility through random seeds, run IDs, and scenario preservation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations</h3>
<p>SEIR: Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered epidemiological model.</p>
<p>Rt: Effective reproduction number over time.</p>
<p>Scenario: Saved simulation configuration with initial conditions.</p>
<p>Intervention: User-defined policy action (lockdown, vaccination, capacity changes).</p>

<h3>1.4 Overview</h3>
<p>
The architecture and key subsystems of SimuCrisis are presented in this High-Level
Design Report. Boundary conditions, global control logic, data persistence,
hardware/software mapping, and subsystem decomposition are all covered. The whole
design is summarized using visual diagrams.
</p>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<h2>2. Current software architecture</h2>
<p>
SimuCrisis does not currently have a software architecture. The project was created from
the ground up and is intended to be modular for testing and incremental development.
</p>

<h2>3. Proposed software architecture</h2>

<h3>3.1 Overview</h3>
<p>
The modular architecture of SimuCrisis allows the Simulation Core to broadcast
snapshots to downstream components while maintaining the model state. The Policy
Engine applies user actions that are processed through the User Interface. Time-series
indicators, such as Rt, peaks, and load, are compiled by the Metrics Collector. Heatmaps
and charts are produced by the Visualization Engine. Export and persistence are managed
via Report Generator and Scenario Manager.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Subsystem decomposition</h3>
<ul>
<li>UI Layer (Unity): Dashboard (charts/heatmap), Policy Panel, Parameter Panel, Scenario Comparison UI</li>
<li>Core Layer: Simulation Core, Policy Engine, Metrics Collector, Visualization Engine</li>
<li>Data Layer: Scenario Manager and Report Generator</li>
<li>Local storage for datasets, scenarios, configuration metadata, and run artifacts</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 Hardware / software mapping</h3>
<p><strong>Hardware:</strong> Standard desktop computer (no VR requirement).</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> Unity (C#), optional Python for preprocessing, local file storage.</p>

<h3>3.4 Persistent data management</h3>
<p>
SimuCrisis stores scenarios and simulation run artifacts locally. Stored data includes
dataset identifiers, parameter configurations, intervention schedules, random seeds,
and summary statistics. No personal or private health information is stored.
</p>

<h3>3.5 Access control and security</h3>
<p>
The system runs locally and does not require user authentication in its initial version.
Scenario validation mechanisms prevent corrupted or invalid configurations.
</p>

<h3>3.6 Global software control</h3>
<p>
The system follows an event-driven control structure. User actions trigger parameter
updates, and each simulation timestep produces a snapshot used to update metrics and
visualizations.
</p>

<h3>3.7 Boundary conditions</h3>
<p>
Performance may degrade for very large population sizes. To mitigate this, aggregated
compartment logic and bounded timestep sizes are used. Parameter validation prevents
unstable configurations.
</p>

<h2>5. Diagrams (Architecture / Sequence / UML)</h2>

<p>
The primary design diagrams utilized in SimuCrisis are described in this section. The
system architecture, runtime interactions, and structural arrangement of essential software
components are all summarized in the diagrams. They enhance the written design
description and make the system's operation more understandable.
</p>

<h3>5.1 High-Level Architecture</h3>
<p>
SimuCrisis is shown in the High-Level Architecture Diagram as a layered system made
up of the UI Layer, Core Layer, and Data Layer. Modularity and distinct boundaries of
duty are guaranteed by this division. The UI Layer does not contain simulation logic;
instead, it manages user interaction and visualization controls. The Simulation Core,
Policy Engine, Metrics Collector, and Visualization Engine comprise the Core Layer,
which collectively oversees model execution, interventions, and analytics. The Data
Layer facilitates analysis and repeatability by storing datasets, scenarios, and run
artifacts.

<h3>5.2 Sequence Diagram – Run + Interventions</h3>
<p>
The interaction between system components throughout a simulation run is depicted in
the Sequence Diagram. Model initialization in the Simulation Core comes after user
configuration via the user interface. The simulation progresses, measurements are
updated, and visuals are updated at each timestep. The Policy Engine calculates
parameter changes that impact subsequent timesteps when a policy is applied. This
illustration emphasizes how the simulation is event-driven and iterative.

<h3>5.3 UML Class Diagram (High-Level)</h3>
<p>
A structural summary of the primary software classes and their connections may be found
in the UML Class Diagram. MetricsCollector generates analytical indicators,
PolicyEngine organizes interventions, and SimulationCore controls model state and
advancement. While ScenarioManager and ReportGenerator facilitate export and
persistence, VisualizationEngine concentrates on rendering outcomes. The diagram
places a strong emphasis on modular design and loose connection, enabling future
additions with little impact.

<h2>6. Glossary</h2>

<p><strong>Heatmap:</strong><br>
A spatial visualization technique used to represent the intensity or concentration of a
specific variable across a geographic or simulated space. In SimuCrisis, heatmaps are
primarily used to display infection density and help users visually identify high-risk or
heavily affected areas.
</p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
A stored simulation configuration that includes initial conditions, disease parameters,
and a predefined set of intervention policies. Scenarios allow users to reproduce
experiments, compare different strategies, and analyze outcomes under consistent starting
assumptions.
</p>

<p><strong>Intervention:</strong><br>
A user-defined policy action applied during a simulation run to influence disease
dynamics. Examples include lockdown measures, vaccination strategies, and healthcare
capacity adjustments. Interventions modify simulation parameters in a controlled manner
over time.
</p>

<p><strong>Snapshot:</strong><br>
A representation of the complete simulation state captured at a specific timestep.
Snapshots include population distributions, calculated metrics, and relevant system
variables, and are used for both real-time visualization and post-simulation analysis.
