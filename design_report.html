<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<h3>1.1 Purpose of the system</h3>
<p>
A pandemic simulation system for education called SimuCrisis was created with Unity.
Its goal is to assist users in investigating the ways in which pandemic management
choices such as lockdowns, vaccination plans, and modifications to healthcare capacity
affect the spread of viruses and the burden on healthcare systems. The system is aimed at
politicians, researchers, educators, and students.
</p>

<h3>1.2 Design goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>A visual representation of pandemic dynamics that is easy to understand.</li>
<li>Availability on common desktop hardware (VR was eliminated because of its low added value).</li>
<li>Instantaneous feedback for parameter adjustments and interventions.</li>
<li>Architecture that is flexible, maintainable, and modular.</li>
<li>Reproducibility through random seeds, run IDs, and scenario preservation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations</h3>
<p>The susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered epidemiological model is known as SEIR.</p>
<p>Rt: The number of effective reproductions over time.</p>
<p>Scenario: Initial conditions and a saved simulation setup.</p>
<p>Intervention: A policy implemented by users (lockdown, immunization, capacity adjustments).</p>

<h3>1.4 Overview</h3>
<p>
The architecture and key subsystems of SimuCrisis are presented in this High-Level
Design Report. Boundary conditions, global control logic, data persistence,
hardware/software mapping, and subsystem decomposition are all covered. The whole
design is summarized using visual diagrams.
</p>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<h2>2. Current software architecture</h2>
<p>
SimuCrisis does not currently have a software architecture. The project was created from
the ground up and is intended to be modular for testing and incremental development.
</p>

<h2>3. Proposed software architecture</h2>

<h3>3.1 Overview</h3>
<p>
The modular architecture of SimuCrisis allows the Simulation Core to broadcast
snapshots to downstream components while maintaining the model state. The Policy
Engine applies user actions that are processed through the User Interface. Time-series
indicators, such as Rt, peaks, and load, are compiled by the Metrics Collector. Heatmaps
and charts are produced by the Visualization Engine. Export and persistence are managed
via Report Generator and Scenario Manager.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Subsystem decomposition</h3>
<ul>
<li>UI Layer (Unity) • Dashboard (charts/heatmap), Policy Panel, Parameter Panel, Scenario Compare</li>
<li>Core Layer</li>
<li>Data Layer: Simulation Core, Policy Engine, Metrics Collector, Visualization Engine,
Scenario Manager, and Report Generator</li>
<li>Local storage, configuration/metadata (seeds, provenance), and dataset repository</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 Hardware/software mapping</h3>
<p><strong>Hardware:</strong> A typical desktop computer (no need for virtual reality).</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> C#, Unity, Python, and local file storage; dataset packs for historical baselines are optional.</p>

<h3>3.4 Persistent data management</h3>
<p>
SimuCrisis stores scenarios and run artifacts locally. Stored artifacts include selected
dataset identifiers, parameter sets, intervention schedules, random seeds for
reproducibility, and summary statistics. No personal or private health data is stored.
</p>

<h3>3.5 Access control and security</h3>
<p>
SimuCrisis runs locally and does not require user authentication in its initial release.
Scenario files can be validated (schema checks) before loading to avoid corrupted inputs.
Any future online sharing features would require access control and secure transport.
</p>

<h3>3.6 Global software control</h3>
<p>
The system follows an event-driven update loop. User actions (start/pause/speed changes,
policy application) trigger events that update simulation parameters. Each timestep
produces a snapshot that feeds metrics computation and visualization refresh.
</p>

<h3>3.7 Boundary conditions</h3>
<p>
Performance may degrade for very large population sizes or dense spatial heatmaps. To
mitigate this, the simulation can use aggregated compartmental logic and bounded
timestep sizes. Parameter validation prevents unstable configurations (e.g., negative rates,
impossible capacities).
</p>

<h2>6. Glossary</h2>

<p><strong>Heatmap:</strong><br>
A spatial visualization technique used to represent the intensity or concentration of a
specific variable across a geographic or simulated space. In SimuCrisis, heatmaps are
primarily used to display infection density and help users visually identify high-risk or
heavily affected areas.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
A stored simulation configuration that includes initial conditions, disease parameters,
and a predefined set of intervention policies. Scenarios allow users to reproduce
experiments, compare different strategies, and analyze outcomes under consistent starting
assumptions.</p>

<p><strong>Intervention:</strong><br>
A user-defined policy action applied during a simulation run to influence disease
dynamics. Examples include lockdown measures, vaccination strategies, and healthcare
capacity adjustments. Interventions modify simulation parameters in a controlled manner
over time.</p>

<p><strong>Snapshot:</strong><br>
A representation of the complete simulation state captured at a specific timestep.
Snapshots include population distributions, calculated metrics, and relevant system
variables, and are used for both real-time visualization and post-simulation analysis.</p>
